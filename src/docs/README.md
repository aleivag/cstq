-----

A very simple and, at least according to the author, intuitive library to navigate Python source code, and code modeling 
based on [libcst](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST).

## Enough said, I need some action!

In code as in screenwriting, it's better to show rather than tell. So, here are a couple of examples that scratch the surface of 
this library. 

### Installation

First things first, let's install the library

```console
pip install cstq
```

### Example base code 

To start working with cstq, you can pass the path to a Python file or pass the module directly by:


```dumas[python]
from cstq import Query

q = Query("""
import sys

def main() -> None:
    import os
    print('hello world' if os.environ.get("USER") else "who are you?")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
""")
```

Now lets get down to business

## Basic Navigation

There are 3 types of basic navigation:

### 1. Direct Attribute Access

You can navigate by referencing attributes directly.


```dumas[python]
q
```
```dumas[python]
# access the body attribute of the main module
q.body
```
```dumas[python]
# you can get all elements
q.body[:]
```
```dumas[python]
# and get the body element of every element in the body of module 
# (if they have one)
q.body[:].body  
```

```dumas[python]
# or just the body elements of the first element of the module
q.body[0].body[:]
```
and then get the node (and the code) back as

```dumas[python]
q.body[0].body[0].node()
```

```dumas[python]
# and then get the code for that node
q.body[0].body[0].code_for_node()
```

```dumas[python]
q.body[0].body[:].names[0].name.node()
```
### 2. Filtering

Filtering allows you to "filter" the current selection of nodes to specific ones. Each one of these accepts either a 
[`libcst.matchers`](https://libcst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers_tutorial.html) or a callback (more on callbacks later). 
`libcst.matchers` presents a very powerful query language, and when that's not enough, you can always fall back to a custom callback.


```dumas[python]
import libcst.matchers as m

```

```dumas[python]
# main root nodes
q.body[:]

```

```dumas[python]
# filter out function definitions using explicit filter
q.body[:].filter(m.FunctionDef())
```

```dumas[python]
# filter out function definitions using implicit filter
q.body[m.FunctionDef()]
```

By using the `.filter` method, you can filter any selection. For instance, `q.body[:]` represents the elements of the body of 
the module. However, you can also filter out by using the `__getitem__` operation (`[.. add your filter here ...]`), 
making it a bit more compact.

### 3. Searching

If you want to search, not only in the current selection but also at every level, you can use `.search`. Similar 
to `.filter`, it accepts a `libcst.matchers` or a callback.

```dumas[python]
q.search(m.Import())
```

```dumas[python]

# get the __name__ == "__main__" using search and filter
q.search(m.If()).filter(lambda n: n.test.code() == '__name__ == "__main__"')
```

```dumas[python]
# combining multiple search and filters into a single statement 
q.search(m.If(), lambda n: n.test.code() == '__name__ == "__main__"')
```

### using callbacks

`.filter` and `.search` can take a callback method that takes an _extended version_ of a CSTNode and returns true or false.
The extended version of the CSTNode its the regular CSTNode with a couple of extra methods like `.parent()` to give your the parent,
and `.code()` to generate the code that node represents, soo far I haven't added anything else.

### codemod (changes)

If you want to change your python document, it's not hard to do, we provide a couple of simple methods like

* **`.change(callable, **kwargs)`**: to change the contents of a collection of nodes.
* **`.replace(node)`**: change the collection of nodes for a new one.
* **`.remove()`**: removes every node from the collection of nodes.
* **`.insert(index, node)`** : if the collection of nodes are a range, this insert the node, in the position index.
* **`.append(node)`** : add the node to the end of the range of nodes
* **`.extend(list[node] | collection of nodes)`** :extend the range to the collection or list of nodes

for instance removing the first import would be as easy as finding it
(using any combination of `.search` and/or `.filter`) and then call `.remove()`

```dumas[python]
q.body[0].body[0].remove()
```

```dumas[python]
# print the code on top
q.code()
```

As you can see, there are several empty lines at the top. This is because of 2 things, first the module object is 
defined to have 1 empty line as a header, and the funtion def has the leading_lines attribute set to also have a empty line

```dumas[python]
q.header[:].node()
```

```dumas[python]
q.body[0]
```

```dumas[python]
q.body[0].leading_lines[:].node()
```


Let's address this by simply changing the attribute `leading_lines` in that function definition using the method `.change`

```dumas[python]
q.body[0].change(leading_lines=[])
```

```dumas[python]
q.code()
```

for more complex changes, instead of passing the attributes to change, you can pass a callback


```dumas[python]
# reverse the order of leading lines

q.body[0].change(lambda node: node.with_changes(leading_lines=node.leading_lines[::-1]))
```

you can replace a node with another one


```dumas[python]
# Lets create an "import from" node and using the serach and node function,
# and then lets use that node to replace the "import" on our module.

import_from = Query("from python_wrapper import os").search(m.ImportFrom()).node()

q.search(m.Import()).replace(import_from)
q.code()
```

To add a import at the top of the file, we can `.insert` the new node at the top, like this

```dumas[python]
# Let's add the import at the top level

import libcst as cst
q.body.insert(0, cst.SimpleStatementLine(body=[import_from]))
```

```dumas[python]
# Let's remove the inner import
q.search(m.FunctionDef()).search(m.ImportFrom()).remove()
```
```dumas[python]
# Let's print the result
q.code()
```

adding a call at the end would be as easy as

```dumas[python]
# using extend to add a few lines at the end of the document

EXTRA_LINES = Query(
    """
import my_custom_logging
my_custom_logging.log(__file__)
    """
)

q.body.extend(EXTRA_LINES.body[:])

q.code()

```

### CST to objects and object to CST

One particular thing this library tries to do, its to give you many representations of the data, so you
can interact with the source code as conformable as you can, for this sometimes you want to grab a python
object from the source code and treat it as its regular object and then turn the result back to its 
CST representation this is not extremely hard to do 

```dumas[python]

from cstq import Query, obj2cst
import libcst.matchers as m

q = Query("""
X = [1, 2, 3, "foo", 3j]
""")

the_list= q.search(m.List())
the_list
```


```dumas[python]
# now we can turn that cst.List object into a python list using using `literal_eval_for_node`

real_list = the_list.literal_eval_for_node()
f"type({real_list}) = {type(real_list)} "
```

```dumas[python]
# lets remove non integers for it and lets write it back to the cst

only_int_list = obj2cst(
[
    e for e in real_list if isinstance(e, int)
]
)

the_list.replace(only_int_list)

q.code()

```
